###### *Started July 1, 2024*

Welcome to my `Web Development Learning Repository`! This **repository** contains all the projects I've created to practice and enhance my web development skills. By starting from the fundamentals and committing to daily practice, I aim to build a solid foundation and continuously improve my abilities. 

## Contents
1. **HTML Basics**
2. **CSS Styling**
3. **JavaScript Fundamentals**
4. **Advanced Projects**

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the projects and explore the code. Each project is contained within its own folder and includes a README file with details about the project, the skills practiced, and any special instructions.

### Prerequisites

To view and run the projects, you will need:
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A code editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-web-development.git
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd learning-web-development/project-folder
3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the project.

### Future Plans
I plan to continue adding more projects as I learn new concepts and technologies in web development. Stay tuned for updates!
